## [1.9.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed 

- Do not print traffic classified as "unknown" in the proxy by default

## [1.9.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed 

- Proxy grouping fixed/improved

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed 

- Proxy now learns dynamic endpoints as the flow is going on, calls classified as 'unknown' are not logged by default

## [1.8.10] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- malformed custom-scheme credential offer links in the Keycloak demo apps by preserving the original `openid-credential-offer://` and `haip-vci://` URIs after scheme validation instead of normalizing them through `url.Parse(...).String()`
- wallet UI manual URI detection so `haip-vci://...` offers are routed to issuance instead of the presentation parser

## [1.8.9] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- lint and security issues in the wallet presentation port probing logic by binding temporary listeners to `127.0.0.1` and handling listener close errors explicitly
- Keycloak example offer-link rendering by validating allowed wallet URI schemes before passing them through to the HTML templates

## [1.8.8] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- interactive wallet issuance now defers `credential_offer_uri` fetches until after user consent instead of dereferencing remote offers just to render the modal
- interactive wallet issuance now shows imported credentials immediately after approval and surfaces issuance errors in the wallet UI instead of failing silently

## [1.8.7] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- interactive wallet issuance after UI approval now reuses the parsed credential offer instead of refetching one-shot `credential_offer_uri` endpoints
- wallet UI issuance approvals now surface errors correctly and refresh imported credentials immediately on success
- Keycloak example offer links now render as the correct custom wallet schemes instead of broken sanitized browser URLs

## [1.8.6] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- aligned the HAIP Keycloak example structure and docs with the baseline issuer+verifier example so both are easier to compare as reference setups

### Fixed

- `wallet accept --auto-accept` now reuses an already running wallet server instead of conflicting on the local port
- `wallet accept` without an explicit port now probes the standard wallet port before falling back to a one-shot server
- HAIP example helper layout and related scripts/build wiring were cleaned up

## [1.8.5] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- a new `keycloak-issuer-verifier-haip-app` example covering HAIP-style authorization-code issuance and x509-based verifier authentication
- wallet support for interactive authorization-code issuance callbacks via the local `/callback` endpoint

### Changed

- simplified and cleaned up the Keycloak example set so the demo apps and bootstrap flows are easier to follow as reference implementations
- expanded the OIDF conformance runner coverage for Browser API and HAIP flows

### Fixed

- Browser API handling for multisigned OpenID4VP request objects
- mdoc Browser API session transcript generation for `dc_api` / `dc_api.jwt`
- multiple issuance and verification issues in the combined Keycloak demo flows

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- `wallet remove --all` for clearing the stored wallet more easily

### Fixed

- example setup and bootstrap issues in the combined Keycloak issuer/verifier demo
- interactive wallet issuance behavior so headed mode no longer behaves like silent auto-accept
- Keycloak demo support files so generated trust-list and signing material are handled correctly

## [1.8.3] - 2026-04-11

### Changed

- macOS wallet URL-handler behavior now distinguishes between interactive mode and explicit `--auto-accept` background import

### Fixed

- headed issuance flows now surface the wallet instead of silently importing like auto-accept mode
- the combined Keycloak demo app now logs out through Keycloak instead of only clearing the local session

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Keycloak-based example setups for issuer-only, verifier-only, and combined issuance + verification flows
- a combined Keycloak demo app with smoke tests and bootstrap scripts for end-to-end issuance and wallet login flows

### Fixed

- credential-offer and issuer-metadata parsing for the new Keycloak issuance example flows

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- SIOPv2 only mode and require-encrypted-request was not enforced

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Browser API presentation support at `/api/dc-api` for OpenID4VP `dc_api` and `dc_api.jwt` response modes, including `web-origin:` client binding and wallet-side Browser API result handling
- HAIP wallet conformance coverage for the current OID4VP 1.0 Final and OID4VCI 1.0 Final HAIP plans, including `dc_api.jwt` VP scenarios

### Changed

- the OIDF wallet conformance runner now targets the current OID4VP 1.0 Final, OID4VCI 1.0 Final, and HAIP wallet plans by default
- the wallet now requests `credential_response_encryption` when issuers advertise it and accepts encrypted JWE credential responses in the authorization code flow

### Fixed

- wallet-generated ETSI trust lists now use the required top-level `LoTE` JSON binding wrapper instead of the previously emitted unwrapped payload
- trust-list parsing and format detection now reject the old non-conformant unwrapped trust-list shape
- proxy JWE tests now match the current `EncryptJWE` API so the full suite builds cleanly again

## [1.7.4] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- updated the conformance runner to target the current OpenID4VP / OID4VCI 1.0 variant names

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- compatibility with the then-current wallet conformance test suite

## [1.7.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- authorization errors are now returned to the verifier instead of being dropped locally
- `direct_post.jwt` responses now preserve `state`

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- trust-list parsing and decoded output now preserve and expose `ListAndSchemeInformation.NextUpdate`

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed

- `/api/trustlists` now exposes a container-friendly relative `path` for each trust-list profile entry
- `/api/trustlists` now publishes `advertised_url` for the configured issuer URL and keeps `url` as a backward-compatible alias

### Documentation

- clarified that `/api/trustlists` is a local discovery endpoint while `/api/trustlists/{id}` serves the ETSI trust-list JWT
- documented how Docker and Testcontainers callers should resolve trust-list `path` values against the URL they actually used

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- multiple wallet trust-list profiles with `/api/trustlists`, `/api/trustlists/{id}`, and CLI selection via `wallet trust-list --id|--vct|--doctype`
- signed OpenID Credential Issuer metadata and registrar-style authorization responses for wallet-issued credential types
- trust-profile-specific credential-signing leaf certificates under the shared wallet CA

### Changed

- `issue --wallet` now issues with the wallet issuer context instead of generating externally and importing afterward
- wallet issuer and status-list URLs are now persisted and reused across commands so generated credentials, `wallet serve`, trust lists, and status lists stay aligned
- wallet trust lists remain ETSI-shaped and certificate-centric while issuer authorization data is published through issuer metadata and registrar responses

### Fixed

- `issue --wallet` credentials now validate against the wallet trust list and use wallet-managed status-list entries by default
- `wallet generate-pid`, `wallet serve`, `wallet trust-list`, `wallet ca-cert`, `wallet tls-cert`, and `validate --trust-list` now work coherently against the same persisted wallet issuer state
- trust-list parsing accepts current ETSI-style `ListIssueDateTime` payloads

### Documentation

- documented trust-list creation, profile IDs such as `pid` and `local`, wallet-native `issue --wallet` behavior, and the shared-CA/per-profile-leaf certificate model

## [1.5.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- `wallet tls-cert` now prints exactly one leaf PEM certificate; `wallet ca-cert` prints exactly one CA PEM certificate

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- `wallet ca-cert` to print or export the shared wallet CA certificate

### Changed

- wallets under the same wallet base directory now share one persisted CA
- the shared CA now anchors wallet trust lists, status-list `x5c` chains, issuer-metadata `x5c` chains, and HTTPS wallet certificates
- HTTPS wallet certificates are now signed by the shared CA instead of being self-signed
- no wallet API endpoint paths or response formats changed; only the trust model and certificate material changed

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- wallet-generated PID credentials now use the HTTPS wallet status list endpoint on `port+1`
- `wallet issuer-tls-cert` was renamed to `wallet tls-cert` to reflect that the exported certificate covers all HTTPS wallet endpoints
- persisted HTTPS wallet certificate files were renamed to `wallet-tls-cert.pem` / `wallet-tls-key.pem` with legacy migration from the old issuer-prefixed names
- `wallet serve` now prints both HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs where both are available

### Documentation

- clarified that `/api/trustlist` and `/api/statuslist` are also exposed via HTTPS
- updated wallet, validate, docker, and README docs for `wallet tls-cert` and HTTPS status-list resolution

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- persistent wallet issuer HTTPS certificate files in the wallet directory
- `wallet issuer-tls-cert` to print or export the HTTPS issuer certificate used by `/.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer`

### Changed

- validate UI banner now prefers the status-list validation result when a status check ran

### Fixed

- local validation fetches now bypass proxies and correctly trust the wallet's self-signed local HTTPS endpoints for issuer metadata and status-list resolution

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- statuslist entries for generate-pid/validate checks statuslist
