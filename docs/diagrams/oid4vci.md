# OID4VCI Flows

This page covers the OID4VCI flows implemented by `oid4vc-dev` when it acts as a wallet receiving a credential offer.

## Flow Map

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Browser
    participant Wallet as oid4vc-dev
    participant Issuer as Issuer / AS

    Browser->>Wallet: Open credential offer
    Wallet->>Issuer: Fetch issuer metadata
    alt Offer uses pre-authorized code
        Wallet->>Issuer: Token request with pre-authorized_code and optional tx_code
    else Offer uses authorization code
        Wallet->>Issuer: PAR request
        Wallet->>Issuer: Authorization request via request_uri
        Wallet->>Issuer: Token request with code + PKCE
    end
    Wallet->>Issuer: Credential request with proofs.jwt
    opt transaction_id returned
        Wallet->>Issuer: Deferred credential request
    end
    Issuer-->>Wallet: Credential
    Wallet->>Wallet: Import credential
```

## Common Inputs

| Field / setting | Why it matters in `oid4vc-dev` |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `credential_offer` or `credential_offer_uri` | One of these must exist for the wallet to start the issuance flow. |
| `credential_issuer` | Used to fetch `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` and resolve the token and credential endpoints. |
| `credential_configuration_ids` | The wallet uses the first configuration ID to resolve format and, in the authorization-code flow, the scope. |
| `c_nonce` | Used to bind the credential proof JWT when the issuer or authorization server provides it. |
| `authorization_details[].credential_identifiers` | If present in the token response, `oid4vc-dev` uses `credential_identifier` at the credential endpoint instead of `credential_configuration_id`. |
| Issuer metadata `credential_response_encryption` support | When advertised, the wallet requests encrypted credential responses and decrypts compact JWE responses. |

## Pre-authorized Code Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Browser
    participant Issuer as Issuer / AS
    participant Wallet as oid4vc-dev

    Browser->>Wallet: Open credential offer URI
    Wallet->>Issuer: Fetch issuer metadata
    Wallet->>Issuer: POST token request<br/>grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code
    Note over Wallet,Issuer: Optional tx_code is included when the wallet was given one.
    Issuer-->>Wallet: access_token, optional c_nonce,<br/>optional authorization_details
    Wallet->>Issuer: POST credential request with proofs.jwt
    alt Encrypted credential response
        Issuer-->>Wallet: compact JWE credential response
        Wallet->>Wallet: decrypt response
    else Plain credential response
        Issuer-->>Wallet: credential
    end
    Wallet->>Wallet: import credential
```

### Relevant Parameters

| Field / setting | Used how |
|-----------------|----------|
| `grants.urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code.pre-authorized_code` | Required to choose the pre-authorized code branch. |
| `grants...tx_code` | Optional. If present, the issuer expects an out-of-band transaction code; the wallet can send it via `wallet accept --tx-code ...`. |
| `access_token` | Used to authorize the credential endpoint call. |
| `c_nonce` | If returned, the wallet rebuilds the proof JWT against that nonce. If missing, it may try a nonce endpoint or a first credential request to obtain one. |
| `credential_identifier` vs `credential_configuration_id` | `credential_identifier` wins when the token response exposes it; otherwise the wallet falls back to the first `credential_configuration_id` from the offer. |

## Authorization Code Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Browser
    participant Issuer as Issuer / AS
    participant Wallet as oid4vc-dev

    Browser->>Wallet: Open credential offer URI
    Wallet->>Issuer: Fetch issuer metadata and OAuth metadata
    Wallet->>Issuer: POST PAR request<br/>response_type=code, client_id, redirect_uri,<br/>scope, PKCE, optional issuer_state
    Issuer-->>Wallet: request_uri
    Wallet->>Issuer: Open authorization request<br/>client_id + request_uri + state
    Issuer-->>Wallet: redirect_uri?code=...&state=...
    Wallet->>Issuer: POST token request<br/>grant_type=authorization_code + code + PKCE
    Issuer-->>Wallet: access_token, optional c_nonce,<br/>optional authorization_details
    Wallet->>Issuer: POST credential request with proofs.jwt
    alt Deferred issuance
        Issuer-->>Wallet: transaction_id
        Wallet->>Issuer: POST deferred credential request
        Issuer-->>Wallet: credential
    else Immediate issuance
        Issuer-->>Wallet: credential
    end
    opt Notification callback
        Wallet->>Issuer: POST notification_endpoint with notification_id
    end
    Wallet->>Wallet: import credential
```

### Relevant Parameters

| Field / setting | Used how |
|-----------------|----------|
| `oid4vc-dev wallet serve --vci-client-id ...` | Required. The wallet will reject the authorization-code flow without a configured client ID. |
| `oid4vc-dev wallet serve --vci-redirect-uri ...` | Required. The wallet will reject the authorization-code flow without a configured redirect URI. |
| OAuth metadata `pushed_authorization_request_endpoint` | Required. `oid4vc-dev` always uses PAR for this flow. |
| OAuth metadata `authorization_endpoint` | Required for the interactive authorization redirect. |
| OAuth metadata DPoP support | Required. The current auth-code implementation expects DPoP-capable issuer metadata. |
| `credential_configuration_ids[0] -> scope` | The wallet resolves the scope from the selected credential configuration and uses it in PAR. |
| `grants.authorization_code.issuer_state` | If present, forwarded into the PAR request. |
| `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` | `oid4vc-dev` supports `private_key_jwt` and `attest_jwt_client_auth` here. Unsupported methods are rejected. |
| `transaction_id` + `deferred_credential_endpoint` | If the credential response is deferred, the wallet follows this branch automatically. |
| `notification_id` + `notification_endpoint` | If both are present, the wallet sends a notification after successful import. |
