# Spec Compliance

Status of implemented features against the relevant specifications.

## OID4VP 1.0 (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Authorization request parsing | Implemented | `openid4vp://`, `haip-vp://`, `eudi-openid4vp://` schemes |
| `request_uri` (GET) | Implemented | Fetches and parses signed request objects |
| `request_uri_method=post` | Implemented | Sends `wallet_metadata` and `wallet_nonce`; strict mode rejects missing `wallet_nonce` in the response |
| Encrypted request objects (JWE) | Implemented | `--require-encrypted-request` flag |
| DCQL query evaluation | Implemented | Including `credential_sets` constraints |
| `direct_post` response mode | Implemented | |
| `direct_post.jwt` response mode | Implemented | JARM-encrypted responses |
| JAR (signed request objects) | Implemented | Strict mode verifies the JWS signature with the leaf `x5c` key and rejects failures; debug mode logs findings and continues |
| `x509_san_dns:` client_id | Implemented | Verified against leaf cert SAN |
| `x509_hash:` client_id | Implemented | SHA-256 thumbprint matching |
| `redirect_uri:` client_id | Implemented | Parsed, no additional validation |
| `verifier_attestation:` client_id | Validated | Checks JWT structure in header, verifies `sub` claim matches client_id |
| `decentralized_identifier:` client_id | Validated | DID format validation, `kid` cross-check (full DID resolution not implemented) |
| VP Token as JSON array | Implemented | Multiple credentials in a single response |
| `fragment` response mode | Implemented | Builds redirect URL with vp_token/state as fragment params; not the default |
| SIOPv2 self-issued `id_token` | Implemented | `response_type=vp_token id_token` or `id_token` alone |
| Request object `typ` header | Enforced in strict mode | Debug mode logs a warning and continues |
| `trusted_authorities` (`etsi_tl`) | Implemented | Filters credentials by issuer certificate chain against ETSI trust list |
| `transaction_data` | Enforced in strict mode | Debug mode logs a warning and continues; strict mode rejects unsupported `transaction_data` |


## OID4VCI 1.0 (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Credential offer parsing | Implemented | `openid-credential-offer://` scheme |
| Pre-authorized code grant | Implemented | With optional `tx_code` |
| Authorization code grant | Not implemented | Optional per spec; offers with only `authorization_code` are rejected |
| Token endpoint | Implemented | Exchanges pre-authorized code for access token |
| Credential endpoint | Implemented | Uses OID4VCI 1.0 final `proofs.jwt` and sends `credential_identifier` or `credential_configuration_id` as required |
| Batch credential issuance | Not implemented | Optional per spec |
| Deferred credential issuance | Not implemented | Optional per spec |

## HAIP 1.0 (High Assurance Interoperability Profile)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `response_mode` must be `direct_post.jwt` | Enforced | With `--haip` flag |
| `client_id` must use `x509_hash:` | Enforced | With `--haip` flag |
| Signed request object (JAR) required | Enforced | With `--haip` flag |
| DCQL query required | Enforced | With `--haip` flag |
| Request object `alg` must be ES256 | Enforced | With `--haip` flag |

## SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Parsing (header, payload, disclosures) | Implemented | |
| `_sd` claim resolution | Implemented | Recursive |
| Array disclosures | Implemented | `...` sentinel values |
| Key Binding JWT | Implemented | Generated during presentation |
| Signature verification (ES256/384/512) | Implemented | |
| Signature verification (RS256/384/512, PS256) | Implemented | |
| SHA-256/384/512 disclosure digests | Implemented | |
| Disclosure digest integrity check | Implemented | Verifies each disclosure hash appears in `_sd` arrays |

| DeviceResponse generation | Implemented | |
| COSE_Sign1 verification | Implemented | ES256/384/512, PS256, RS256 |
