# Wallet

A stateful testing wallet with file persistence, CLI-driven OID4VP/VCI flows, QR scanning, and OS URL scheme registration. Credentials and keys are stored in `~/.oid4vc-dev/wallet/` (configurable via `--wallet-dir`) and persist across invocations.

The wallet has two validation modes:
- `debug` (default) keeps processing requests when possible and logs spec findings for debugging; during DCQL evaluation it warns and keeps a credential match when some required claim paths are missing but other requested claims still match
- `strict` rejects requests that violate the latest final specs

For OpenID Foundation conformance work, see [docs/conformance.md](./conformance.md).

## Quick start

```bash
# Generate PID credentials and list them (re-running replaces existing PIDs)
oid4vc-dev wallet generate-pid
oid4vc-dev wallet generate-pid --claims '{"given_name":"MAX","family_name":"POWER"}'
oid4vc-dev wallet list

# Show a credential (raw)
oid4vc-dev wallet show <id>

# Show a credential (human-readable decoded)
oid4vc-dev wallet show --decoded <id>

# Start the wallet web UI with stored credentials
oid4vc-dev wallet serve

# Start the wallet and register URL scheme handlers
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --register

# Export the shared wallet CA for verifier trust stores
oid4vc-dev wallet ca-cert --out wallet-ca-cert.pem

# Export the HTTPS wallet certificate for verifier trust stores
oid4vc-dev wallet tls-cert --out wallet-tls-cert.pem

# Process an OID4VP request from the CLI
oid4vc-dev wallet accept 'openid4vp://authorize?client_id=...'

# Accept a credential offer (auto-detected from URI)
oid4vc-dev wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...'

# Scan a QR code from screen and auto-detect the flow
oid4vc-dev wallet scan --screen

# Import a credential from a file
oid4vc-dev wallet import credential.txt

# Register URL scheme handlers so openid4vp:// links open the wallet
oid4vc-dev wallet register
```

## Storage

All wallet state is stored in `~/.oid4vc-dev/wallet/` by default:

```
~/.oid4vc-dev/
├── wallet-ca-cert.pem  # Shared CA certificate used across wallet instances
├── wallet-ca-key.pem   # Shared CA private key
└── wallet/
    ├── wallet.json       # Credentials + metadata
    ├── holder.pem        # Holder EC private key (auto-generated on first use)
    ├── issuer.pem        # Issuer EC private key (for self-issued credentials)
    ├── wallet-tls-cert.pem # HTTPS certificate for wallet endpoints on port+1
    └── wallet-tls-key.pem  # HTTPS private key for wallet endpoints on port+1
```

Keys are P-256 EC keys, auto-generated on first use and reused across invocations. Wallets under the same wallet base directory share a persisted **CA key** and build certificate chains from it:

1. **CA certificate** — self-signed, used as trust anchor in the trust list (`/api/trustlist`)
2. **Leaf certificate** — signed by the CA, wraps the issuer key's public key

Generated credentials are signed with the **issuer key**. SD-JWT credentials include a deterministic `kid` header, expose the signing key through JWT VC issuer metadata, and include the leaf signing certificate in `x5c`. The shared trust-anchor CA stays in the wallet trust list so verifiers can validate the signing key through the exposed trust chain instead of trusting a bare public key.

The shared CA key is persisted and reused across wallet instances in the same base directory. Each wallet keeps its own issuer key, and its credential-signing leaf certificate and HTTPS wallet certificate are minted from that shared CA.

Generated credentials expire in **30 days** by default. Use `--exp` to override (e.g. `--exp 720h` for 30 days, `--exp 24h` for 1 day). Use `--nbf` to set a not-before time (RFC3339 or duration, e.g. `--nbf 2025-01-15T00:00:00Z` or `--nbf -1h`).

![Wallet UI](./wallet-ui.png)

## `wallet show <id>`

Displays a stored credential by its ID (as shown in `wallet list`). By default, outputs the raw credential string. Use `--decoded` for human-readable decoded output (supports `--json` and `-v` global flags).

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet show <id>                  # Raw credential string
oid4vc-dev wallet show --decoded <id>        # Human-readable output
oid4vc-dev wallet show --decoded --json <id> # JSON output
```

| Flag        | Default | Description                                          |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `--decoded` | `false` | Show human-readable decoded output instead of raw    |

## `wallet serve`

Starts a persistent wallet HTTP server with a web UI for managing credentials and handling OID4VP/OID4VCI flows. Loads credentials from disk and saves state on credential changes. Includes request logging with timestamps and a browser-based consent UI for incoming requests.

The server exposes:
- Web UI for credential management and consent
- OID4VP authorization endpoint (`/authorize`)
- Legacy ETSI trust list endpoint (`/api/trustlist`) — use this URL as `--trust-list` when validating PID credentials issued by the wallet
- Trust-list index endpoint (`/api/trustlists`) with one JWT endpoint per coherent trust-list profile
- HTTPS wallet endpoints on `https://<host>:<port+1>`, including `/.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer`, `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer`, `/api/trustlist`, `/api/trustlists`, `/api/statuslist`, and `/api/registrar/wrp`

The shared wallet CA can be exported with `wallet ca-cert` for verifier trust stores or CI fixtures. The per-wallet HTTPS leaf certificate can still be exported with `wallet tls-cert` when you need the exact server certificate instead. The wallet continues to serve the same endpoints and response formats on top of that shared trust root.
The trust list remains certificate- and service-centric. EUDI-style issuer authorization data such as provider entitlements and `providesAttestations` is published through signed OpenID Credential Issuer metadata and registrar-style responses instead of being added as custom trust-list fields.

The wallet persists an issued-attestation registry alongside the stored credentials. Each issued or imported credential type can register:
- its attestation identifier (`vct` or `docType`)
- its registrar entitlements
- its trust-list profile data such as LoTE type, entity name, and issuance or revocation service type identifiers

Trust lists are created from that registry, not by scanning certificates alone:
- `wallet generate-pid` and `wallet serve --pid` register PID attestation types with the PID trust-list profile
- `issue ... --wallet` issues with the wallet issuer context, stores the credential, and registers one issued-attestation entry for its credential type
- `wallet import` registers a default issued-attestation entry for the imported credential type
- credentials whose stored trust-list profile fields are identical are grouped into the same trust list

Credential-signing certificates are derived per trust-list profile. The wallet keeps one shared CA root, but credentials for different profiles can present different leaf certificates while still chaining to that same CA.

When a wallet already has persisted issuer or status-list URLs, `wallet serve` reuses them by default so previously generated credentials keep resolving against the same issuer metadata, trust-list, and status-list endpoints. Passing `--base-url` or `--docker` explicitly replaces that default.

The wallet groups registered attestation entries by trust-list profile. Each group is exposed as its own trust list under `/api/trustlists/{id}`. The `id` is a stable profile identifier:
- `pid` for the built-in PID profile
- `local` for the built-in local ETSI-shaped profile
- `tl-<hash>` for any additional custom profile

`/api/trustlists` is a local discovery endpoint for those profiles. It is not the ETSI trust-list payload itself. Each entry includes:
- `id`, for example `pid` or `local`
- `path`, for example `/api/trustlists/pid`
- `advertised_url` when the wallet has an issuer URL configured, for example `https://localhost:8086/api/trustlists/pid`
- `url` as a backward-compatible alias for `advertised_url`

Clients that call the wallet through Docker port mappings, reverse proxies, or Testcontainers should resolve `path` against the URL they actually used to reach `/api/trustlists`. `advertised_url` is the wallet's configured publication URL and may intentionally differ from the caller's local route.

`/api/trustlist` remains the backward-compatible legacy endpoint. Its selection rules are:
- if a PID trust-list profile exists, `/api/trustlist` returns that PID trust list
- if no PID profile exists, `/api/trustlist` returns the first available profile
- `vct` and `doctype` query parameters can be used to select the trust list for a specific credential type

Examples:
- `/api/trustlists/pid`
- `/api/trustlists/local`
- `/api/trustlist?vct=eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1`
- `/api/trustlist?doctype=org.iso.23220.photoid.1`

Example discovery response:

```json
{
  "trust_lists": [
    {
      "id": "pid",
      "default": true,
      "path": "/api/trustlists/pid",
      "advertised_url": "https://localhost:8086/api/trustlists/pid",
      "url": "https://localhost:8086/api/trustlists/pid",
      "loTEType": "http://uri.etsi.org/19602/LoTEType/EUPIDProvidersList"
    },
    {
      "id": "local",
      "default": false,
      "path": "/api/trustlists/local",
      "advertised_url": "https://localhost:8086/api/trustlists/local",
      "url": "https://localhost:8086/api/trustlists/local",
      "loTEType": "http://uri.etsi.org/19602/LoTEType/local"
    }
  ]
}
```

When the wallet needs a local default profile, it uses:
- `LoTEType = http://uri.etsi.org/19602/LoTEType/local`
- `SvcType/Issuance`
- `SvcType/Revocation`

Use `--register` to also register OS URL scheme handlers so that `openid4vp://`, `haip-vp://`, `openid-credential-offer://`, and `haip-vci://` links automatically open the wallet.

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet serve
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --port 9000 --auto-accept
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --pid --credential extra.txt
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --register           # also register URL scheme handlers
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --register --port 9000
```

| `--status-list`         | `false`  | Embed status list references in generated credentials (auto-enabled with `--pid`) |
| `--base-url`            | —        | Base URL for the HTTP status list endpoint; its host is also reused for HTTPS wallet endpoints (default status list HTTP: `http://localhost:<port>`, HTTPS: `https://localhost:<port+1>`) |
| `--docker`              | `false`  | Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` for both HTTP and HTTPS wallet endpoint URLs |
| `--haip`                      | `false`  | Enforce HAIP 1.0 compliance checks on incoming requests |
| `--require-encrypted-request` | `false` | Require verifiers to encrypt request objects (sends encryption key in `wallet_metadata`) |

## `wallet accept <uri>`

Auto-detects the URI type and dispatches to the appropriate flow:

- `openid4vp://`, `haip-vp://`, `eudi-openid4vp://` → OID4VP presentation (evaluates DCQL, shows consent UI, submits VP token)
  - Supports `response_type=vp_token id_token` (SIOPv2 + OID4VP combined flow) — generates a self-issued ID token alongside the VP token
  - Supports `response_type=id_token` (SIOPv2 only) — generates a self-issued ID token without VP token
- `openid-credential-offer://`, `haip-vci://` → OID4VCI credential issuance (fetches credential from issuer)

In interactive mode (default), OID4VP requests start a temporary consent UI server and auto-open it in the browser. With `--auto-accept`, auto-selects and submits the first matching credentials.

When DCQL is present, `debug` mode is intentionally forgiving for troubleshooting verifier queries: if a credential matches the requested format and metadata and at least one requested claim, the wallet logs a warning and still keeps that credential as a match even when other required claim paths are missing. `strict` mode treats the same query as non-matching.

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet accept 'openid4vp://authorize?...' --auto-accept
oid4vc-dev wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...'
oid4vc-dev wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...' --tx-code 123456
```

| Flag                    | Default  | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `--port`                | `8085`   | Server port for OID4VP                           |
| `--auto-accept`         | `false`  | Auto-approve OID4VP presentations                |
| `--mode`                | `debug`  | Validation mode: `debug` or `strict`             |
| `--session-transcript`  | `oid4vp` | mDoc session transcript mode: `oid4vp` or `iso`  |
| `--tx-code`             | —        | Transaction code for OID4VCI pre-authorized code flow |
| `--haip`                | `false`  | Enforce HAIP 1.0 compliance checks on incoming requests |

Note: only the pre-authorized code grant type is supported. Offers that only contain an `authorization_code` grant will be rejected with a clear error message.

## `wallet scan`

Scans a QR code from an image file or screen capture and auto-detects the content:

- `openid4vp://` → delegates to `accept` (OID4VP presentation)
- `openid-credential-offer://` → delegates to `accept` (OID4VCI issuance)
- SD-JWT / mDoc raw credential → delegates to `import`

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet scan qr-image.png
oid4vc-dev wallet scan --screen              # macOS interactive screen capture
oid4vc-dev wallet scan --screen --auto-accept # auto-approve if it's a presentation
```

`wallet scan` honors the persistent `wallet --mode` flag when it dispatches OID4VP/VCI flows.

## `wallet trust-list`

Generates and prints the ETSI trust list JWT containing the wallet's CA certificate (trust anchor). The trust list is used by verifiers to validate the x5c/x5chain certificate chain embedded in credentials. It intentionally stays certificate-centric and does not embed issuer authorization data such as provider entitlements or `providesAttestations`; those are exposed through `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` and `/api/registrar/wrp`.

`wallet trust-list` prints the same trust list as the legacy `/api/trustlist` endpoint. If the wallet has a PID trust-list profile, that PID trust list is printed. Otherwise the first available profile is printed.

Use `--id`, `--vct`, or `--doctype` when you want a specific trust-list profile instead of the legacy default. Typical profile IDs are `pid` and `local`.

The output can be piped to a file or used directly with `--trust-list` in the `validate` command. Use `--url` to print only the URL for a running wallet server instead.

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list                          # Print the trust list JWT
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list > trustlist.jwt          # Save to file
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list --url                    # http://localhost:8085/api/trustlist
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list --id pid --url           # http://localhost:8085/api/trustlists/pid
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list --id local --url         # http://localhost:8085/api/trustlists/local
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list --doctype org.iso.23220.photoid.1 --url
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list --url --port 9000        # http://localhost:9000/api/trustlist
oid4vc-dev wallet trust-list --url --docker           # http://host.docker.internal:8085/api/trustlist
```

| Flag       | Default | Description                                        |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `--url`    | `false` | Print only the trust list URL (for a running server) |
| `--id`     | —       | Select a trust-list profile ID such as `pid` or `local` |
| `--vct`    | —       | Select the trust list covering this SD-JWT `vct`    |
| `--doctype`| —       | Select the trust list covering this mdoc `docType`  |
| `--port`   | `8085`  | Wallet server port (used with --url)                |
| `--docker` | `false` | Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` (used with --url) |

## `wallet ca-cert`

Loads or creates the shared wallet CA certificate and prints exactly one PEM certificate. All wallets under the same wallet base directory use this CA for trust lists, status-list `x5c` chains, issuer-metadata `x5c` chains, and HTTPS wallet endpoints.

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet ca-cert
oid4vc-dev wallet ca-cert --out wallet-ca-cert.pem
```

| Flag    | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `--out` | —       | Write the shared wallet CA certificate PEM to a file instead of stdout |

## `wallet tls-cert`

Loads or creates the HTTPS leaf certificate used by the wallet's HTTPS endpoints and prints exactly one PEM certificate. Use `--out` to write the certificate to a file for verifier trust stores in automated tests. Use `wallet ca-cert` when you want the shared trust root instead of the leaf.

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet tls-cert
oid4vc-dev wallet tls-cert --out wallet-tls-cert.pem
oid4vc-dev wallet tls-cert --docker --out wallet-tls-cert.pem
oid4vc-dev wallet tls-cert --base-url http://wallet:8085 --out wallet-tls-cert.pem
```

Use the same `--port`, `--docker`, and `--base-url` flags as `wallet serve` so the exported certificate matches the HTTPS wallet host that the running wallet presents.

| Flag         | Default | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| `--out`      | —       | Write the certificate PEM to a file instead of stdout |
| `--port`     | `8085`  | Wallet server port (certificate will match HTTPS wallet endpoints on `port+1`) |
| `--docker`   | `false` | Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` when deriving the HTTPS wallet host |
| `--base-url` | —       | Base URL used to derive the HTTPS wallet host |

## `wallet register` / `wallet unregister`

Registers (or removes) OS-level URL scheme handlers so that `openid4vp://`, `eudi-openid4vp://`, `haip-vp://`, `openid-credential-offer://`, and `haip-vci://` links automatically open the wallet.

The handler script first tries to POST to a running `wallet serve` instance. If the server is not running, it falls back to invoking the CLI directly (`wallet accept`).

- **macOS**: Creates an AppleScript `.app` bundle in `~/Applications/` and registers via Launch Services
- **Other platforms**: Not supported — use `wallet accept <uri>` instead

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet register               # Register URL handlers (default listener port 8085)
oid4vc-dev wallet register --port 9000   # Use custom listener port
oid4vc-dev wallet unregister             # Remove URL handlers
```

| Flag     | Default | Description                                                    |
|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--port` | `8085`  | Listener port for handler script to try before falling back to CLI |

## HAIP 1.0 Enforcement

This wallet currently enforces the implemented **OID4VP subset** of HAIP 1.0. It does not yet implement the full HAIP issuance profile, Wallet Attestation, Key Attestation, or PAR.

Use `--haip` with `wallet serve` or `wallet accept` to enforce [HAIP 1.0 Final](https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-1_0-final.html) compliance on incoming OID4VP requests. When enabled, the wallet rejects requests that violate any of:

- `response_mode` must be `direct_post.jwt`
- `client_id` must use the `x509_hash:` scheme
- A signed request object (JAR) must be present
- The query must use DCQL (not presentation definitions)
- The request object signing algorithm must be `ES256`

Non-compliant requests receive an HTTP 400 error with details about which checks failed.

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --haip --auto-accept --pid
oid4vc-dev wallet accept --haip 'openid4vp://authorize?...'
```

## Testing API

The wallet server exposes API endpoints for automated testing scenarios. These let you control wallet behavior programmatically — useful for E2E test suites that need to simulate errors or select specific credential formats.

### One-shot error override

Pre-program the wallet to return an error for the next presentation request, even in auto-accept mode. The override is consumed after one use.

**Set override:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/next-error \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"error": "access_denied", "error_description": "User denied consent"}'
```

The next OID4VP authorization request will return the configured error instead of processing normally:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "access_denied",
  "error_description": "User denied consent"
}
```

After that single request, the wallet resumes normal behavior.

**Clear override without consuming:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8085/api/next-error
```

| Method   | Path              | Body                                                        | Description                |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `POST`   | `/api/next-error` | `{"error": "...", "error_description": "..."}`              | Set one-shot error override |
| `DELETE` | `/api/next-error` | —                                                           | Clear override              |

### Preferred credential format

When a DCQL query matches both SD-JWT and mDoc credentials (e.g. both PID formats), the wallet normally picks whichever option appears first. The preferred format setting lets you control which format wins.

**Set preference:**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8085/api/config/preferred-format \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"format": "dc+sd-jwt"}'
```

**Clear preference:**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8085/api/config/preferred-format \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"format": ""}'
```

| Method | Path                           | Body                    | Description                    |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `PUT`  | `/api/config/preferred-format` | `{"format": "dc+sd-jwt"}`  | Prefer SD-JWT when multiple match |
| `PUT`  | `/api/config/preferred-format` | `{"format": "mso_mdoc"}`   | Prefer mDoc when multiple match   |
| `PUT`  | `/api/config/preferred-format` | `{"format": "jwt_vc_json"}` | Prefer JWT VC when multiple match |
| `PUT`  | `/api/config/preferred-format` | `{"format": ""}`            | Clear preference (default)        |

The preference can also be set at startup via `--preferred-format`:

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --auto-accept --pid --preferred-format dc+sd-jwt
```

### Credential import

Credentials can be imported at runtime via `POST /api/credentials`. The body is the raw credential string. Supported formats:

| Format | Detection | Stored as |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| SD-JWT | Contains `~` separator | `dc+sd-jwt` |
| Plain JWT | 3-part JWT without `~` | `jwt_vc_json` |
| mDoc | CBOR-encoded | `mso_mdoc` |

Plain JWT VCs are presented as-is (no selective disclosure, no KB-JWT). Use `"format": "jwt_vc_json"` in DCQL queries to match them.

```bash
# Import an SD-JWT
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials \
  -d 'eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9.eyJ2Y3QiOiJ...~eyJhbGci...~'

# Import a plain JWT VC
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials \
  -d 'eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9.eyJ2Y3QiOiJ...'
```

### Status list

When you generate PID credentials with `wallet generate-pid` or `wallet serve --pid`, generated credentials include a `status.status_list` claim pointing to the wallet's HTTPS status list endpoint. You can also force the same behavior explicitly with `--status-list`. The URI baked into credentials is `https://<host>:<port+1>/api/statuslist`, derived from the same host-selection logic as the wallet's issuer metadata endpoint.

The HTTPS issuer URL for wallet-generated credentials is derived from the same host-selection mechanism. By default it is `https://localhost:<port+1>` and serves both `/.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer` and the signed `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` metadata endpoint, plus `/api/registrar/wrp` for registrar-style authorization data.
Those endpoints use certificate chains rooted in the shared wallet CA.

**Important:** If the verifier runs in Docker (or any environment that can't reach `localhost`), use `--docker` (or `--base-url` for a custom URL) so both the status list URL and the issuer metadata host are reachable:

```bash
# Verifier on the same host
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --pid

# Verifier in Docker (shortcut for --base-url http://host.docker.internal:<port>)
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --pid --docker

# Custom base URL
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --pid --base-url http://my-host:8085
```

The status of individual credentials can be changed at runtime:

```bash
# Revoke a credential (status=1)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials/<id>/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status": 1}'

# Un-revoke (status=0)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials/<id>/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status": 0}'
```

The status list JWT is served at `GET /api/statuslist` on both the HTTP wallet port and the HTTPS wallet port.

### Encrypted request objects (`request_uri_method=post`)

OID4VP 1.0 Section 5.10 defines an optional mechanism where the wallet POSTs its capabilities and an encryption key to the verifier's `request_uri` endpoint, instead of using a plain GET. This allows the verifier to encrypt the request object so that only the wallet can read it.

**Note:** This is an OID4VP 1.0 feature. HAIP 1.0 does not mention `wallet_metadata`, `wallet_nonce`, or `request_uri_method`. Use this to test verifiers that support the optional encrypted request object flow.

Enable with `--require-encrypted-request`:

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --auto-accept --pid --require-encrypted-request
```

When enabled, the wallet:

1. Generates an ECDSA P-256 encryption key at startup
2. When `request_uri_method=post` is set in the authorization request, POSTs to the `request_uri` with:
   - `wallet_metadata` — JSON object containing `vp_formats_supported`, `request_object_signing_alg_values_supported`, and `jwks` with the wallet's public encryption key
   - `wallet_nonce` — base64url-encoded random nonce for replay protection
3. Expects the verifier to encrypt the request object as a JWE (ECDH-ES + A128GCM or A256GCM) using the wallet's public key
4. Decrypts the received JWE to extract the signed JWT request object
5. In `debug` mode, validates that `wallet_nonce` in the response matches the one sent and warns if it is missing
6. In `strict` mode, rejects the flow if the response omits `wallet_nonce`

The proxy dashboard surfaces `request_uri_method`, `wallet_metadata`, and `wallet_nonce` in the decoded traffic view when these fields are present.

Without `--require-encrypted-request`, the wallet still supports `request_uri_method=post` (sending `wallet_metadata` without encryption keys and validating `wallet_nonce`), but does not include encryption keys or attempt JWE decryption.

### Example: E2E test flow

```bash
# 1. Start wallet in headless mode with both PID formats
oid4vc-dev wallet serve --auto-accept --pid --preferred-format dc+sd-jwt &

# 2. Import an additional credential
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials -d @credential.txt

# 3. Run normal presentation (succeeds, uses SD-JWT)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/presentations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"uri": "openid4vp://authorize?..."}'

# 4. Pre-program an error for the next request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/next-error \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"error": "access_denied", "error_description": "Simulated denial"}'

# 5. Next presentation returns the error (consumed after one use)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/presentations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"uri": "openid4vp://authorize?..."}'

# 6. Switch to mDoc preference
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8085/api/config/preferred-format \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"format": "mso_mdoc"}'

# 7. Next presentation uses mDoc instead of SD-JWT
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/presentations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"uri": "openid4vp://authorize?..."}'
```

## Shared flag

All wallet subcommands accept `--wallet-dir` to override the storage directory:

```bash
oid4vc-dev wallet list --wallet-dir /tmp/test-wallet
```
